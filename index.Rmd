# Introduction and Motivation {-}

This R book will be used to show my work as a work through UT Austin's "Reporting With Data" class taught by Christian McDonald. This book is *not* a required component of the class, but rather a personal project I wanted to do for myself to give me a place to track my progress and also allow me to build upon the concepts I learn in class.

## Goals {-}

I want to achieve the following goals with this book:

- To give myself a place to practice and develop my skills on my own
- To keep track of my progress in order to see how far I have come in my data journalism journey
- To demonstrate my abilities as a data journalist by sharing my code 

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
